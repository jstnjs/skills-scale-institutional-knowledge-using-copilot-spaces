Use this checklist to onboard any new project role/persona:

- [ ] Review role summary and key responsibilities in `octoacme-roles-and-personas.md`
- [ ] Meet with immediate collaborators (PM, PdM, Dev, QA, etc.)
- [ ] Get access to core repositories, boards, and process docs
- [ ] Review current project status, backlog, and recent retrospectives
- [ ] Schedule intro meeting with stakeholders, if applicable
- [ ] Review relevant process templates and checklists
- [ ] Identify and surface any gaps in responsibilities or overlaps

*Customize per role as required.*
